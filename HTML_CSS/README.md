# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

* <a href="https://github.com/FurmanG/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Space%20Station%20Site">Space Station Site</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/FurmanG/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Movies%20Theater%20Site">Movie Theater Site</a>

<b>Space Station Site</b><br> 
This page is an example home page for a space travel company.<br> 
It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

<b>Movie Theater Site</b><br>
This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Boostrap 4.<br>
It contains many Boostrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
