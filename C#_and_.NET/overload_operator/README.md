The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br> 
These is a basic project written in C-Sharp.<br> 
This repository contains my assignment and drill.<br>
As part of the bootcamp at The-Tech-Academy's C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br>
The assignment asks for:<br>
1. Create an Employee class with Id, FirstName and LastName properties. <br> 
2. In the Employee class, overload the “==” operator so it checks if two Employee objects are equal by comparing their Id property. Remember that comparison operators must be overloaded in pairs.<br> 
3. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.<br>
