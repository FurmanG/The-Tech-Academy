# Polymorphism_interface
The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br> 
These is a basic project written in C-Sharp.<br> 
This repository contains my assignment and drill.<br>
As part of the bootcamp at The-Tech-Academy's C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br>
The assignment asks for:<br>
1. Create an interface called IQuittable and have it define a void method called Quit().<br> 
2. Have your Employee class from the previous drill inherit that interface and implement the Quit() method in any way you choose.<br> 
3. Use polymorphism to create an object of type IQuittable and call the Quit() method on it. Hint: an object can be of an interface type if it implements that specific interface.<br> 
4. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.<br> 
Step: 306
