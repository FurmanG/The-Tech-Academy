# abstract_class
The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br> 
These is a basic project written in C-Sharp.<br> 
This repository contains my assignment and drill.<br>
As part of the bootcamp at The-Tech-Academy's C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br>
The assignment asks for:<br>
1. Create an abstract class called Person with two properties: string firstName and string lastName.<br> 
2. Give it the method SayName().<br> 
3. Create another class called Employee and have it inherit from the Person class.<br> 
4. Implement the SayName() method inside of the Employee class.<br> 
5. Inside the Main() method, instantiate an Employee object with firstName “Sample” and lastName “Student”. Call the SayName() method on the object.<br> 
6. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.<br>
