# Method_overloading_assignment
The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br> 
These is a basic project written in C-Sharp.<br> 
This repository contains my assignment and drill.<br>
As part of the bootcamp at The-Tech-Academy's C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br>
The assignment asks for:<br>
1. Create a class. In that class, create a method that will take in an integer, create a math operation for this integer (addition, subtraction, etc.), then return the answer as an integer.<br>
2. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the one method, passing in an integer. Display the result to the screen.<br>
3. Add a second method to the class with the same name that will take in a decimal, create a different math operation for it, then return the answer as an integer.<br>
4. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the second method, passing in a decimal. Display the result to the screen.<br>
5. Add a third method to the class, with the same name, that will take in a string, convert it to an integer if possible, do a different math operation to it, then return the answer as an integer.<br>
6. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the third method, passing in a string that equates to an integer. Display the result to the screen.<br>
7. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.<br>
