# Calling-Methods-Assignment
The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br> 
These is a basic project written in C-Sharp.<br> 
This repository contains my assignment and drill.<br>
As part of the bootcamp at The-Tech-Academy's C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br>
The assignment asks for:<br>
1. Create a class. In that class, create three methods, each of which will take one integer parameter in and return an integer. The methods should do some math operation on the received parameter. Put this class in a separate .cs file in the application.<br>
2. In the Main() program, ask the user what number they want to do the math operations on.<br>
3. Call each method in turn, passing the user input to the method. Display the returned integer to the screen.<br>
4. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.<br>
