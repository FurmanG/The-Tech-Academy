# Method_two_parameters_optional
The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br> 
These is a basic project written in C-Sharp.<br> 
This repository contains my assignment and drill.<br>
As part of the bootcamp at The-Tech-Academy's C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br>
The assignment asks for:<br>
1. Create a class. In that class, create a method that takes two integers as parameters. Make one of them optional. Have the method do a math operation and return an integer result.<br>
2. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class.<br>
3. Ask the user to input two numbers, one at a time. Let them know they need not enter anything for the second number.<br>
4. Call the method in the class, passing in the one or two numbers entered.<br>
5. Try various combinations of numbers on the code, including having no second number.<br>
6. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.<br>
