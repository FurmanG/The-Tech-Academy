The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br> 
These is a basic project written in C-Sharp.<br> 
This repository contains my assignment and drill.<br>
As part of the bootcamp at The-Tech-Academy's C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br>
The assignment asks for:<br>
1. Create a class. In that class, create a void method that outputs an integer. Have the method divide the data passed to it by 2.<br> 
2. In the Main() method, instantiate that class.<br> 
3. Have the user enter a number. Call the method on that number. Display the output to the screen. It should be the entered number, divided by two.<br> 
4. Create a method with output parameters.<br> 
5. Overload a method.<br> 
6. Declare a class to be static.<br> 
7. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.<br>
