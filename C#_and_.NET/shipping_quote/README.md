The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br> 
These is a basic project written in C-Sharp.<br> 
This repository contains my assignment and drill.<br>
As part of the bootcamp at The-Tech-Academy's C-Sharp and .NET Course.<br>
The assignment asks for:<br>
Your job is to create a console-based application for getting a shipping quote for a package.<br>
REQUIREMENTS:<br>
1. The first line of the program must be: “Welcome to Package Express. Please follow the instructions below.”<br>
2. The user must then be prompted for the package weight.<br>
3. If the weight is greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too heavy to be shipped via Package Express. Have a good day.” At this point the program would end.<br>

4. The user must then be prompted for the package width.<br>

5. Then the package height.<br>

6. Then the package length.<br>

7. If the dimensions total greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too big to be shipped via Package Express.” At this point the program would end.<br>

8. Next, multiply the three dimensions (height, width, & length) together, and multiply the product by the weight. Finally, divide the outcome by 100.<br>

9. The result of that calculation is the quote.<br>

10 Display the quote to the user as a dollar amount.<br>

11. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.<br>
